description
The development of the script is done at http://kotka.de/projects/enhancedcommentify/index.html. Releases may be downloaded from below.

There is a major rework for Vim7 underway. In case you are missing any features, this is the time to suggest them. Send me an email or report your bugs or suggestions in the trac at the link above. This is a serious request from me to the users. In the past a lof of people complained on mailing lists, that "this doesn't work" or "that feature is missing", without contacting me. If you don't tell the upstream author, then this won't change!

Stay tuned.
 
install details
Simply drop the script in your .vim/plugin directory. There is a detailed EnhancedCommentify.txt, since there are to much options to explain here. Put it in your .vim/doc directory and issue the ':helptags ~/.vim/doc' command. ':help EnhancedCommentify' should then give you any information you need in order to use the new features of the script.
