For more information about using this plugin, after installing the
taglist plugin, use the ":help taglist" command.
 
install details
1. Download the taglist.zip file and unzip the files to the $HOME/.vim or the
    $HOME/vimfiles or the $VIM/vimfiles directory. After this step, you should
    have the following two files (the directory structure should be preserved):

         plugin/taglist.vim - main taglist plugin file
         doc/taglist.txt    - documentation (help) file

   Refer to the |add-plugin|, |add-global-plugin| and |runtimepath| Vim
   help pages for more details about installing Vim plugins.
2. Change to the $HOME/.vim/doc or $HOME/vimfiles/doc or $VIM/vimfiles/doc
    directory, start Vim and run the ":helptags ." command to process the
    taglist help file. Without this step, you cannot jump to the taglist help
    topics.
3. If the exuberant ctags utility is not present in your PATH, then set the
    Tlist_Ctags_Cmd variable to point to the location of the exuberant ctags
    utility (not to the directory) in the .vimrc file.
4. If you are running a terminal/console version of Vim and the terminal
    doesn't support changing the window width then set the
    'Tlist_Inc_Winwidth' variable to 0 in the .vimrc file.
5. Restart Vim.
6. You can now use the ":TlistToggle" command to open/close the taglist
    window. You can use the ":help taglist" command to get more information
    about using the taglist plugin.
