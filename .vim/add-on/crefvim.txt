description
The intention of this project is to provide a C-reference manual that can
be viewed with Vim and accessed from within Vim.
The C-reference is a reference, it is NOT a tutorial or a guide on how
to write C-programs. It is a quick reference to the functions and syntax
of the standard C language.

There are several ways to specify a word CRefVim should search for in order
to view help:

  <Leader>cr normal mode:  get help for word under cursor
                           Memory aid cr: (c)-(r)eference
  <Leader>cr visual mode:  get help for visually selected text
                           Memory aid cr: (c)-(r)eference
  <Leader>cw:              prompt for word CRefVim should search for
                           Memory aid cw: (c)-reference (w)hat
  <Leader>cc:              jump to table of contents of the C-reference manual
                           Memory aid cc: (c)-reference (c)ontents

Note: by default <Leader> is \, e.g. press \cr to invoke C-reference

Note: The best way to search for an operator (++, --, %, ...) is to visually
select it and press <Leader>cr.

To get help do :help crefvimdoc
To show the C-reference manual do :help crefvim
 
install details
CRefVim consists of four files, the script 'crefvim.vim', its
documentation 'crefvimdoc.txt', the C-reference 'crefvim.txt' and a syntax
file to extend the standard syntax highlighting for help files called
'help.vim'.

Copy the script "crefvim.vim" to your local plugin-directory
  Unix:    ~/.vim/plugin
  Windows: c:\vimfiles\plugin

You have to add the documentation and the C-reference to Vim's help
system. To do this, copy both 'crefvimdoc.txt' and 'crefvim.txt' to
your local doc-directory:
  Unix:    ~/.vim/doc
  Windows: c:\vimfiles\doc

Then start Vim and do:
  :helptags ~/.vim/doc   (or :helptags c:\vimfiles\doc for Windows)


Finally the standard help syntax highlighting must be extended, so that
the C-reference is viewed correctly. To do so, copy the file 'help.vim' to
your local after/syntax directory:
  Unix:    ~/.vim/after/syntax
  Windows: c:\vimfiles\after\syntax

This extention of the help syntax file is only active for the C-reference
manual.


That's all to do.
